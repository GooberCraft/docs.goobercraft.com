# For Non-Technical Users

Welcome! We want **everyone** to be able to contribute to Goobercraft documentation, regardless of technical skill level.

## You Don't Need to Be a Developer!

If you can:

- ✅ Edit text
- ✅ Click buttons
- ✅ Copy and paste

Then you can contribute to our documentation! **No coding required.**

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Edit on GitHub (Easiest!)

**Best for:** Small edits, typo fixes, simple updates

1. Find the page you want to edit on GitHub
2. Click the pencil icon ✏️
3. Make your changes
4. Click "Propose changes"

## Getting Help

### Before You Start

- Read [QUICK_EDIT_GUIDE.md](QUICK_EDIT_GUIDE.md) - Beginner-friendly instructions
- Look at existing pages for examples
- Use a template from `_templates/`

### While Editing

- Copy formatting from similar pages
- Don't stress about perfection
- Ask questions in Discord

### After Submitting

- Check for comments on your pull request
- Respond to any feedback
- Ask for help if confused

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "What if I break something?"

You can't! GitHub keeps a full history, so nothing can be permanently broken. Worst case, we can undo changes.

### "What if my formatting is wrong?"

The automated linter will catch most issues. Maintainers will help fix anything that needs fixing. Don't let formatting stop you from contributing!

### "What if I don't know how to use Git/GitHub?"

Use GitHub's web editor - it handles Git for you! Or check out the VS Code option, which makes it even easier.

### "What if my grammar isn't perfect?"

Content matters more than perfect grammar. Editors will help polish the language if needed.

### "What if I'm not sure my contribution is good enough?"

Submit it anyway! The worst that happens is someone suggests improvements. Your effort is valued regardless.

### "Will someone judge my technical skills?"

Never. We appreciate all contributions equally. Everyone starts somewhere, and documentation contributions are valuable regardless of technical background.

## Tips for Success

### ✅ Do This

- Start with small edits to get comfortable
- Ask questions when unsure
- Look at existing pages for examples
- Use templates when creating new pages
- Be patient with the review process

### ❌ Don't Worry About

- Perfect formatting (tools help with this)
- Being "technical enough" (you are!)
- Making mistakes (they're fixable!)
- Asking "dumb questions" (they don't exist)
