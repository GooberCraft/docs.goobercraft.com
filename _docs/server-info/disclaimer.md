**This document is subject to change at anytime without notice please reference it often.**

_We will post important changes in discord announcements but it is always best practice to reference this document directly. If we make changes that affect the community as a whole we will make sure to give people ample time to make the necessary changes to accommodate the new rules._

_While we try not to do this, it does sometimes happen as the community grows and new experiences arise._
