## Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to server"

**Possible solutions:**

- Verify the server address is correct: `play.goobercraft.com`
- Check if the server is online (visit Discord for status)
- Ensure you're using the correct Minecraft version
- Restart Minecraft and try again

### "Outdated client" or "Outdated server"

**Solution:**

- You're using the wrong Minecraft version
- Switch to version X.XX.X in the launcher
- Restart and reconnect

### "Failed to verify username"

**Possible causes:**

- Your internet connection is unstable
- Minecraft authentication servers are down
- You're using a cracked/unofficial Minecraft client (not supported)

**Solutions:**

- Check your internet connection
- Restart Minecraft
- Verify your Minecraft account is valid

### Connection timeout

**Solutions:**

- Check your internet connection
- Try disabling VPN if you're using one
- Check firewall settings (Minecraft needs access to the internet)
- Contact your ISP if the problem persists

### "You are banned from this server"

**Reason:**

- Your account has been banned for rule violations

**Action:**

- Review our [consequences policy](/docs/community-rules/consequences/)
- Follow the appeal process if you believe this was in error

## Using Direct Connect

For a one-time connection without saving the server:

1. Click **"Multiplayer"**
2. Click **"Direct Connect"**
3. Enter: `play.goobercraft.com`
4. Click **"Join Server"**

## Connecting with Multiple Accounts

If you play with multiple Minecraft accounts:

- Each account must connect separately
- Alt accounts must follow all server rules
- Using alts to evade bans will result in permanent bans on all accounts

## Checking Server Status

Before connecting, verify the server is online:

- Check Discord announcements
- Visit *(add website if applicable)*
- Ask in the community Discord

## Mobile/Bedrock Connection

*(Update based on your server setup)*
