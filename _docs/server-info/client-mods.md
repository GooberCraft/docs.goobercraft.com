Client side mods do not require approval by a moderator however, they may not be used if they fall in to one or more of the below categories. If you are found to be using one of these mods, you will face a reminder and/or disciplinary action from the mod team.

This list is not comprehensive. As mods are developed and used more widely, some things may be added or removed from this list in time. The mod team has the right to blacklist any mod we deem to powerful for a vanilla server. If you are ever unsure whether your mod falls into one of the categories below, please reach out to a moderator and we will look into it further.

_**Blacklisted Mod Types:**_

- X-Ray Mods
- Mods that reveals locations of various things (mobs, slime chunks, ores, ore veins, natural structures)
- Mods that can be used to duplicate items
- Mods that give you a further reach
- Mods that change the way you access inventory - if you aren't physically opening the chest, it is too powerful for a vanilla server. (ex: Inventory Tabs, Inventory Profiles Next, Easy Shulker Boxes, Pick Block Pro, etc.)
- Mods that allow for the automatic placement of blocks
- Mods that share unsolicited information or text spam in server chat
- Mods that automatically and/or instantly kill mobs

Specific Blacklisted Mods/Launchers:

- Lunarclient
- Killaura
- "Hacked" clients
- Tweekaroo
- Remove Darkness Effect
- Meteor

You can find two cursed forge mod packs we recommend to use on Goobercraft within the discord.
