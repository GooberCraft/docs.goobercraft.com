We have people who do stream from the server. Please follow these rules as when people are streaming they are making content and working.

**In-game Behavior:**

**All Server Rules Apply**

**Respect Streamer's Personal Time**

- We aim for everyone to have a good experience when on the server. Be respectful of a streamer's time

**Respect Streamer's Personal Space**

- Unless otherwise stated by the person streaming, please give that player space and allow them to play how they wish without any interruption.
- Please ask a streamer if you can hang out and/or help with a project before jumping in.
- Avoid any spammable distracting sounds, such as trident tossing, firework launching, and other noise makery tomfoolery.

**Disciplinary Action**

- Infractions are considered on a case-by-case basis by the mod team and will be handled in accordance with the Community Rules.
