## Consequences for Rule Violations

We believe in fair and consistent enforcement of our community rules. This page outlines the typical consequences for various violations.

## Warning System

Most first-time minor violations will result in a warning. Warnings serve as educational opportunities and give players a chance to correct their behavior.

### Verbal Warnings

- Issued for minor first-time offenses
- Recorded in staff logs
- No immediate gameplay impact

### Formal Warnings

- Issued for repeated minor offenses or moderate violations
- Permanently recorded
- May impact future disciplinary decisions

## Temporary Bans

Temporary bans remove a player from the server for a specified period.

### Duration

- **Short**: 1-7 days (minor repeated violations)
- **Medium**: 1-4 weeks (moderate violations)
- **Long**: 1-3 months (serious violations)

### Common Reasons

- Repeated rule violations after warnings
- Moderate griefing or theft
- Inappropriate chat behavior
- Minor use of prohibited mods or hacks

## Permanent Bans

Permanent bans are reserved for the most serious violations or repeated offenders who show no intent to follow community rules.

### Common Reasons

- Major griefing or destruction
- Severe harassment or hate speech
- Hacking, cheating, or major exploits
- Repeatedly violating rules after multiple bans
- Threats of harm
- Doxxing or sharing private information

### Appeal Process

Players may appeal permanent bans after:

- Minimum 6 months have passed
- Demonstrable understanding of the violation
- Commitment to following rules if reinstated

### Repeat Offenders

Players with a history of violations may face:

### Context Matters

Staff will consider:

## Appeal Process

Players may appeal disciplinary actions by:

1. **Wait Period**: Respect any mandatory waiting period
2. **Submit Appeal**: Contact staff through appropriate channels
3. **Provide Information**: Explain your understanding and any mitigating circumstances
4. **Be Respectful**: Appeals made with hostility will be denied
5. **Accept Decision**: Staff decisions on appeals are final

## Transparency

We strive for transparency in rule enforcement:

- Rules are publicly available
- Consequences are consistent
- Major bans may be announced (without details)
- Appeals are handled fairly

## Questions?
