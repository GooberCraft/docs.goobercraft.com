## Details

The modpack requires the CurseForge client that can be downloaded from here: [https://www.curseforge.com/download/app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)

If you do not have it installed already, I recommend downloading the standalone client as the Overwolf client is kind of heavy resource wise. If you already use Overwolf for other things, feel free to install it via Overwolf.

GooberCraft Season 3 uses a custom modpack.

> **Note**: The Season 3 CurseForge modpack URL will be updated once available.

Once you are on the modpack page, please click "Install" and then "Open CurseForge" when prompted. The modpack will download and install automatically.

## Server IP

To connect to the GooberCraft server, please use: play.goobercraft.com

## Updating The ModPack

To update the modpack, you will need to select the kebab menu _(3 vertical dots)_ next to the play button in the top right of the modpack and select "Change Version." From there select "Update to latest version."

## ModPack Modification

When you install this modpack, it will default to not allowing you to modify the contents of it. If you are looking to add other specific client-side mods or other resources, you're welcome to enable the content modification in the profile options, however, please keep the following in mind:

- The mods in this modpack should **NOT** be updated as these mods are pinned to the specific needed versions for compatibility with the server and other mods in the modpack. If you install a client mod that requires the updating of any of the mods in the client, you may need to _downgrade_ that mod instead.
- Should you modify the contents of the modpack, support will only be provided on a case-by-case basis. We're happy to help with little tweaks to get you going, but heavy modification will be met with telling you to reinstall the provided modpack.
- Please use **extreme** care while modifying the contents of this modpack. If you would like assistance with adding a client mod or two to the pack, we may be able to provide assistance or publish a beta modpack.
