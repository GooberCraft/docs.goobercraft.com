### Goobercraft **Server Rules** {#minecraft-server-rules}

**Be Respectful Always:** Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.

**Semi Family Friendly:** Meaning you may use some Profanity but just dont over do it both in chat and voice call.

**No controversial conversations/arguments:** This includes topics such as, but not limited to religion and Politics.

**No cheating of any kind:** This includes cheats like X-Raying and item duplication (with the exception of TNT duping.)

**No griefing or stealing**: Do not alter another player's build without permission or steal from others. Do not explore/change/modify other players personal builds or chests without permission. Fix any damage caused. If unable to fix, or damage is caused to another player's building, leave a sign and contact the owner as well as a moderator right away.

**Pranks and PvP:** Are allowed on the server but do not go overboard. If you do get asked to stop pranking or pvping by anyone then do not continue.

**We do allow client-side mods but make sure to check out this** [Client-Side Mod Information](/docs/server-info/client-mods/) **section for what is allowed and what is not allowed.**

**Player's Base:** If you come across a location where someone is building a base. Make sure to give them room to build and expand. Unless you are asked to join in within the area.

- Give at least 100 blocks of space between bases.

**Farm Usage:**

- **Farms are Allowed**: Players are welcome to build farms for crops, animals, and mob drops.
- **Limit on Farm Size**: Farms should be of reasonable size to prevent server lag. Avoid building excessively large farms, as this can negatively impact server performance.
- **Lag-Inducing Farms**: Farms that are identified as causing lag (e.g., large crop farms, mob grinders, or auto-breeders) will need to be adjusted or removed. Admins/Mods will have the final say on what constitutes excessive lag.
- **Respect Server Performance**: Always be mindful of server performance when building large farms. Keep designs compact and avoid creating too many constantly active redstone or entity-based components.
- **Admin/Mods Oversight**: Admins/Mods reserve the right to inspect and modify farms if they are causing server issues. Farms that exceed performance limits may be removed or adjusted.
- **Rule Updates**: Farm rules may change to ensure balanced gameplay and server performance. Players will be notified of updates as needed.

**Redstone Usage:**

- **Redstone Circuits are Allowed**: Players are free to use Redstone to create circuits, contraptions, and automated systems.
- **Limit on Redstone Clocks**: Redstone clocks are allowed but should not cause excessive server lag. If a clock is found to be impacting server performance, it may be removed by the admins/Mods.
- **No Constantly Active Contraptions**: Avoid building Redstone contraptions that are constantly active. Use on/off switches or timers to reduce strain on the server.
- **Lag-Inducing Builds**: If your Redstone creation is identified as a source of lag, you will be asked to modify or remove it. Admins/Mods have the final say on what constitutes excessive lag.
- **Respect Other Players**: Do not use Redstone contraptions to grief or annoy other players. This includes building noisy or disruptive devices near other players' bases.
- **Optimize Your Builds**: Players are encouraged to optimize their Redstone builds to minimize the number of active components, such as repeaters, hoppers, and pistons.
- **Admin/Mods Oversight**: Admins/Mods reserve the right to inspect and, if necessary, disable Redstone contraptions that are affecting the server's performance or other players' enjoyment.
- **Limit on Hopper Use**: Hoppers can cause significant lag if used in large quantities. Please limit the number of hoppers in your builds, or consider alternatives where possible.
- **Reporting Issues**: If you notice a Redstone contraption causing server issues, report it to an Admin/Mod rather than attempting to fix it yourself.
- **Rule Updates**: These rules may be updated as needed to address server performance or gameplay concerns. Players will be notified of any changes.

**You are responsible for the actions of your account:** If your account is hacked, please inform a moderator immediately so we can block any unauthorized access to the server. Do not share random links within the community; this is a security risk and is taken very seriously.

_Do not push limits and make us make more rules. Doing so may result in rules being imposed on a case-by-case and player-by-player basis._
