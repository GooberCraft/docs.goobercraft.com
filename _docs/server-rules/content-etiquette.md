We have members who stream or record content from the server. Please remember that when they are live or recording, they are not just playing  they are working and creating content. To support a positive and respectful environment, all players must follow these guidelines:

## In-Game Behavior:

1. **All Server Rules Still Apply**\
   Streaming or recording does not override any existing server rules. Always play respectfully and within our community standards.
2. **Respect Streamers' Time**\
   Streamers are often on tight schedules or creating structured content. Avoid disrupting their flow or pulling them into unplanned activities without checking first.
3. **Respect Personal Space**\
   Unless invited, please give streamers room to create. Don't crowd or interfere with their builds, events, or interactions unless they've said it's okay.
4. **Ask Before Helping or Hanging Out**\
   Always ask a streamer before joining their area, offering help, or being part of their content. Respect their creative direction.
5. **Avoid Distracting Noises or Spam**\
   Please don't use tridents, fireworks, or other spammy/noisy items around streamers. These sounds can disrupt recordings and streams.

## Disciplinary Action

Any infractions related to streaming etiquette will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the staff. Actions taken will align with our overall server rules and may include warnings, timeouts, or bans depending on the situation.

Let's help each other create awesome content and keep the server fun for everyone!
