## Community Guidelines

While our [Community Rules](/docs/community-rules/overview/) define what's required, these guidelines represent best practices that help make Goobercraft a better place for everyone.

## Purpose of Guidelines

Guidelines are:

- **Recommendations** for positive community participation
- **Best practices** learned from our community's experience
- **Suggestions** for getting the most out of your time on Goobercraft
- **Not strictly enforced** but strongly encouraged

## The Spirit of the Guidelines

These guidelines embody our community values:

1. **Cooperation Over Competition**: While friendly competition is fun, we prioritize helping each other succeed
2. **Long-term Thinking**: Consider the long-term impact of your actions on the community
3. **Active Participation**: Engage with the community, not just the game
4. **Continuous Improvement**: We're always learning and growing together

## Guidelines vs. Rules

**Rules** are mandatory and enforced - violations have consequences.

**Guidelines** are voluntary best practices - following them makes you a valued community member but not following them isn't necessarily a rule violation.

That said, consistently ignoring guidelines may affect your standing in the community and how others choose to interact with you.
