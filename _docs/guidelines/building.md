## Building Guidelines

These guidelines help ensure everyone can enjoy building on Goobercraft while respecting others and maintaining a beautiful server environment.

## Claiming Land

### When to Claim

- **Before you build**: Protect your area before placing valuable blocks
- **Size appropriately**: Claim what you need, but don't claim excessive unused land
- **Claim completely**: Ensure your entire build is within your claim

### Claim Etiquette

- Don't claim land you're not actively using
- Release unused claims to make space for others
- Respect claim boundaries - don't build right up to others' claims
- Consider leaving breathing room between builds

## Location and Spacing

### Choosing a Build Location

**Do:**

- Check the area is unclaimed
- Look for a spot with good terrain
- Consider proximity to spawn and other players
- Think about long-term expansion

**Don't:**

- Build immediately next to others without permission
- Take the "last" good spot near spawn if you're not active
- Block important pathways or resources
- Build in designated community areas without approval

### Recommended Spacing

- **Minimum**: 50 blocks from other builds (if unclaimed)
- **Preferred**: 100+ blocks for major projects
- **Courtesy**: Ask nearby neighbors before building close

## Building Standards

### Quality Over Quantity

- Take your time to create quality builds
- Add detail and personality
- Consider the visual impact on neighbors
- Finish projects before starting new ones (when possible)

### Avoid These Building Practices

- **Grief-bait**: Don't build things designed to be griefed
- **Lag machines**: No builds that intentionally cause lag
- **Sky pillars**: Remove temporary scaffolding and pillars
- **1x1 towers**: Clean up exploration pillars
- **Floating trees**: Chop trees completely, including floating leaves
- **Inappropriate builds**: Keep builds family-friendly

## Collaborative Building

### Community Projects

- Coordinate with organizers
- Follow the project's theme and guidelines
- Complete your assigned sections
- Communicate if you can't finish

### Building with Others

- Establish clear roles and responsibilities
- Use shared claims appropriately
- Respect co-builders' creative input
- Credit all contributors

## Resource Management While Building

### Terraforming

- Be mindful when making major terrain changes
- Don't create massive eyesores near others
- Fill in large quarries or mark them clearly
- Replant trees if you clear forests

### Material Gathering

- Don't strip mine directly under others' builds
- Avoid removing all resources from an area
- Use designated resource worlds if available
- Replant and restore when gathering near others

## Temporary vs. Permanent Builds

### Temporary Structures

- Clearly mark as temporary
- Set a reasonable completion or removal timeline
- Remove when no longer needed
- Don't leave abandoned temporary builds

### Permanent Projects

- Commit to maintenance
- Update signs with your username
- Inform staff if taking extended breaks
- Consider allowing others to maintain if you leave

## Abandoned Builds

### If You're Leaving

- Inform staff of long-term absences
- Consider giving builds to active players
- Remove or donate valuable items
- Unclaim land you won't use

### Handling Others' Abandoned Builds

- Don't assume a build is abandoned quickly
- Contact staff, not the player directly
- Wait for official abandonment declaration
- Respect the original builder's work

## Theme and Style

### Server Aesthetics

While we don't enforce building styles:

- Consider the visual harmony with surroundings
- Avoid "random" placement of blocks without purpose
- Take pride in your creations
- Learn from others' builds

### Medieval, Modern, or Fantasy?

All styles are welcome! Just keep them:

- Cohesive within your own build
- Appropriate for all ages
- Respectful of neighbors' themes

## Special Considerations

### Redstone Projects

- Test for lag before full-scale building
- Keep noise (pistons, note blocks) away from others
- Turn off automatic farms when not in use
- Don't create perpetual machines unnecessarily

### Farms and Automation

- Build efficient, not excessive
- Don't create entity lag
- Turn off when not actively using
- Share designs with the community

### Shops and Trade

- Follow economic guidelines
- Price fairly
- Keep shop areas organized
- Maintain stock or close temporarily

## Modification and Renovation

### Updating Your Builds

- Feel free to improve and expand
- Ensure new sections are also claimed
- Maintain the same quality standards
- Consider asking for feedback

### Major Changes

If making dramatic changes:

- Inform neighbors if it affects views
- Consider the impact on surrounding area
- Update paths and access if needed

## Getting Feedback

Want to improve your building?

- Ask experienced builders for tips
- Share WIP screenshots in Discord
- Participate in building events
- Watch tutorials and learn new techniques

## Building Events

We occasionally host building competitions and events:

- Follow event-specific rules
- Respect deadlines
- Have fun and be creative
- Congratulate winners graciously

## Remember

These are guidelines, not strict rules. The goal is to foster a community where everyone can build freely while being considerate of others. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Does this enhance or detract from the community experience?"

Happy building! 🏗️
