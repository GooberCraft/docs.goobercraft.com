## Communication Guidelines

Effective, respectful communication makes Goobercraft a welcoming place for everyone. These guidelines help ensure positive interactions across all community platforms.

## General Communication Principles

### Be Respectful

- Treat others as you'd like to be treated
- Disagree without being disagreeable
- Assume positive intent
- Avoid personal attacks

### Be Clear

- Say what you mean
- Provide context when needed
- Ask for clarification if confused
- Use appropriate channels for different topics

### Be Constructive

- Offer solutions, not just complaints
- Give helpful feedback
- Support others' ideas
- Build others up

## In-Game Chat

### Chat Etiquette

**Do:**

- Welcome new players
- Answer questions helpfully
- Share accomplishments appropriately
- Use proper grammar when possible
- Keep conversations public when appropriate

**Don't:**

- Spam or flood chat
- Use excessive caps (shouting)
- Advertise other servers
- Share personal information
- Dominate conversations

### Language Use

- Keep language family-friendly
- Avoid controversial topics (politics, religion)
- No hate speech or slurs
- Mind your tone - text lacks vocal cues
- Use /msg for private conversations

### Asking for Help

When asking questions:

1. **Check available resources first** (these docs, signs, Discord)
2. **Be specific**: "How do I claim land?" not "help pls"
3. **Be patient**: People volunteer their time
4. **Say thanks**: Appreciate those who help

### Offering Help

When helping others:

- Be patient with new players
- Explain rather than just doing
- Point to resources for learning
- Don't condescend or mock

## Discord Communication

### Channel Usage

- Use appropriate channels for topics
- Read channel descriptions and pinned messages
- Don't cross-post the same message
- Keep threads on topic

### Voice Chat

- Use push-to-talk if background noise is an issue
- Mute when not speaking in large groups
- Respect others' conversation flow
- Keep music/sounds reasonable

### Reactions and Responses

- Use reactions to avoid cluttering chat
- Emoji reactions are powerful - use them
- Don't spam reactions
- Respond in threads for organized discussions

## Forums and Reddit (if applicable)

### Creating Posts

- Use descriptive titles
- Check for existing threads on the topic
- Format for readability
- Include relevant screenshots or info

### Responding

- Read the entire post before responding
- Quote what you're responding to
- Stay on topic
- Edit instead of double-posting

## Handling Disagreements

### When You Disagree

1. **Pause**: Take a breath before responding
2. **Understand**: Make sure you understand their point
3. **Respond respectfully**: "I see it differently because..."
4. **Know when to stop**: Agree to disagree if needed
5. **Take it private**: Move to DMs if getting heated

### When Someone Disagrees with You

- Listen to their perspective
- Don't take it personally
- Consider they might be right
- Thank them for their input
- Move on gracefully

## Reporting Issues

### How to Report Effectively

When reporting problems or rule violations:

1. **Be factual**: Stick to what happened
2. **Include evidence**: Screenshots, coordinates, timestamps
3. **Use proper channels**: Staff DMs or designated channels
4. **Be patient**: Investigations take time
5. **Keep it private**: Don't discuss publicly

### What Not to Do

- Don't "call out" players publicly
- Don't spam reports
- Don't exaggerate or embellish
- Don't expect instant action
- Don't argue if decision isn't what you wanted

## Feedback and Suggestions

We value community input! When providing feedback:

### Constructive Feedback

- Be specific about the issue
- Explain the impact
- Suggest possible solutions
- Stay respectful
- Accept that not all suggestions can be implemented

### Feature Requests

- Check if it's already suggested
- Explain the benefit
- Consider feasibility
- Be open to alternatives
- Don't demand or feel entitled

## Social Media and External Platforms

### Representing Goobercraft

- Be a positive ambassador
- Don't promise what you can't deliver
- Direct questions to appropriate channels
- Keep drama internal, not public

### Sharing Content

- Credit builders and creators
- Get permission for others' builds
- Use appropriate tags
- Follow platform-specific guidelines

## Language Barriers

We're an international community:

- Be patient with non-native speakers
- Avoid complex slang or idioms
- Rephrase if not understood
- Use translation tools when needed
- Never mock language mistakes

## Timing and Availability

### Respecting Others' Time

- Don't expect instant responses
- Consider time zones
- Don't spam if someone doesn't respond
- Understand people have lives outside Minecraft

### Your Own Boundaries

- It's okay to not respond immediately
- Set your status appropriately
- Take breaks when needed
- Say no to things you can't commit to

## Humor and Joking

### Keep It Light

- Jokes should be inclusive, not at others' expense
- Know your audience
- Sarcasm doesn't translate well in text
- If someone asks you to stop, stop
- "Just kidding" doesn't excuse harmful jokes

### Inside Jokes

- Don't overuse to the point of excluding others
- Explain when newcomers are confused
- Ensure they're actually funny to everyone
- Let them die natural deaths

## Constructive vs. Destructive Communication

### Constructive Examples

- "The spawn protection radius might be too large, have we considered reducing it?"
- "I noticed lag during peak hours. Could we investigate?"
- "That build is impressive! How long did it take?"

### Destructive Examples

- "This server sucks, X feature is terrible"
- "Why is everything so laggy, fix it!"
- "That build is ugly lol"

## Special Situations

### Welcoming New Players

- Offer to answer questions
- Show them around if they'd like
- Give them space to explore
- Don't overwhelm with information

### Saying Goodbye

If leaving the community:

## Mental Health Considerations

- Be kind and supportive within your limits

### Your Own Wellbeing
