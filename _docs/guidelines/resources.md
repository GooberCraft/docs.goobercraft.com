## Resource Guidelines

These guidelines promote sustainable resource gathering and fair sharing of server resources for everyone's benefit.

## General Principles

### Sustainable Gathering

- Gather resources thoughtfully
- Don't take more than you need
- Leave resources for others
- Replenish renewable resources
- Think long-term

### Fair Share Mentality

- Server resources are shared by all
- Don't hoard excessively
- Share surplus with new players
- Contribute to community resources

## Mining and Ores

### Mining Etiquette

**Do:**

- Mine in your claimed area or far from spawn
- Fill dangerous holes near popular areas
- Use branch mining or other efficient methods
- Keep mines organized and safe

**Don't:**

- Strip mine directly under others' builds (ask first)
- Create massive ugly quarries near spawn
- Leave 1-block wide pillars everywhere
- Expose diamonds/valuables in others' claims

### Cave Mining

- Light up caves you explore
- Be careful not to flood others' builds
- Mark dangerous areas
- Don't steal from clearly player-made structures

### Sharing Ore Spots

- If you find a rich vein, consider sharing location
- Don't mine every diamond vein on the server
- Leave some for others to discover
- Community spirit builds community

## Forestry and Trees

### Tree Harvesting

**Always:**

- Chop down the entire tree
- Include all wood blocks
- Clear floating leaves (they decay but it's courteous)
- Replant trees

**Consider:**

- Replanting with saplings
- Creating tree farms for personal use
- Not clearcutting entire forests
- Leaving some natural beauty

### Community Tree Farms

- If community farms exist, use them
- Replant what you harvest
- Don't take all saplings
- Report griefing or depletion

## Farming and Food

### Crop Farming

**Public/Community Farms:**

- Replant what you harvest
- Don't trample crops
- Repair broken farming systems
- Share excess crops
- Report grief

**Personal Farms:**

- Protect your farms with claims
- Consider building away from spawn if large
- Minimize entity lag (too many animals)
- Share surplus if you have abundance

### Animal Breeding

- Don't kill the last animals in an area
- Breed, don't just kill
- Keep animal populations reasonable (lag!)
- Use fences and proper containment
- Share breeding pairs with new players

## Nether Resources

### Nether Fortresses

- Don't remove every blaze spawner
- Leave some nether wart for others
- Mark paths to fortresses
- Share coordinates of discoveries

### Ancient Debris/Netherite

- Mine responsibly
- Don't strip mine every chunk
- Leave some for others to find
- Consider the long-term availability

### Nether Travel

- Build safe pathways
- Light up paths
- Don't grief nether portals
- Use highway systems if established

## End Resources

### End Cities and Ships

- Share End gateway locations
- Don't loot every single chest
- Leave some elytra and shulker shells
- Mark already-looted cities

### Shulker Farming

- Use sustainable farms if available
- Don't overharvest wild shulkers
- Share shulker shells with newcomers
- Build proper shulker farms

### End Busting

- Coordinate dragon fights
- Share End portal access
- Don't block End portal
- Help others get through

## Villager Trading

### Trading Halls

- Don't zombify others' villagers without permission
- Share good trades if you find them
- Build secure trading halls
- Help others set up trades

### Villager Breeding

- Keep villager populations reasonable
- Use proper trading hall designs
- Don't create entity lag
- Share villagers if possible

## Ocean Resources

### Ocean Monuments

- Share coordinates of monuments
- Leave some sponges for others
- Mark drained monuments
- Don't grief partial drains

### Coral and Sea Life

- Use Silk Touch for coral
- Don't destroy entire reefs
- Leave tropical fish for others
- Preserve ocean beauty

## Resource Worlds (if applicable)

If your server has resource/mining worlds:

### Usage

- Use these for major resource gathering
- Mine freely without concern
- Don't build permanent structures
- These worlds reset periodically

### Transition Back

- Bring resources to main world
- Don't leave valuable items on reset
- Use these to preserve main world beauty

## Economy and Trading

### Fair Pricing

- Price items fairly
- Don't extreme price gouge
- Consider newer players' budgets
- Compete, but don't destroy the economy

### Sharing vs. Selling

- Some things should be shared freely
- Basic starter supplies: consider donating
- Rare items: fair to sell
- Your choice, but consider community

### Shop Etiquette

- Keep shops stocked or close temporarily
- Update prices if market changes
- Don't monopolize markets
- Support other shops too

## Community Resource Projects

### Contribution

- Donate to community builds
- Stock public farms and supplies
- Help new players with starter kits
- Share your abundance

### Usage

- Take what you need, not all you can
- Leave some for others
- Contribute back when able
- Thank contributors

## Bulk Resource Gathering

### Large Projects

If gathering massive amounts:

- Do it far from spawn
- Use efficient methods
- Restore or mark the area
- Consider spreading out gathering
- Don't deplete finite resources entirely

### Storage

- Keep large storage organized
- Use shulker boxes efficiently
- Don't create entity lag with item frames
- Consider item sorters

## New Player Support

### Helping Newcomers

- Donate starter supplies
- Share your surplus
- Teach sustainable gathering
- Don't just give everything (they should play too!)
- Create starter kits if you're generous

### What to Give

Suggested starter kit:

- Basic tools
- Some food
- A few building blocks
- Maybe some saplings or crops
- Not overpowered items (let them play)

## Resource Conservation

### Renewable vs. Non-Renewable

**Renewable** (harvest freely):

- Wood
- Crops
- Animals
- Mob drops

**Non-Renewable** (harvest considerately):

- Ores
- Ancient debris
- Fossils
- Some structures

### Future Planning

- Consider long-term server health
- Don't exhaust resources near spawn
- Think about players joining months from now
- Sustainability ensures longevity

## Etiquette Summary

**The Golden Rule:**
Gather resources as if you'll be playing on this server for years, and as if others will too.

**Questions to Ask:**

- Am I leaving this area better or worse?
- Am I leaving enough for others?
- Is this sustainable long-term?
- Would I be upset if someone did this to "my" area?

## Reporting Resource Issues

If you notice:

- Depleted resources near spawn
- Griefed farms
- Stolen items from unlocked chests
- Resource hoarding issues

Contact staff through appropriate channels.

## Remember

We're all sharing this world together. Resources gathered thoughtfully and shared generously create a thriving community that everyone enjoys being part of!

Happy gathering! ⛏️
