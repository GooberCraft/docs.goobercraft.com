## Server

### Will you install _X_ mod on the server?

While we know everyone has their favorite mods, we will mostly be unable to accommodate these requests. The current modpack is a product of 4 months of research, testing, and tweaking by the staff and our testers. While we anticipate _some_ issues, changes will mostly only be made in the event of function or performance issues.

### Why is Cave Mode disabled for Xaeros?

Shortly after season launch, cave mode was being abused to quickly find and farm dragons from the Ice and Fire mod. To protect the rest of the population, cave mode was disabled. At this time, there are no plans to reenable it, but never say never as we get later into the season.

## Game

### My gravestone is missing, can you help me get my stuff back?

_**Possibly**._ Please save the obituary from your death as it's the only way for us to know EXACTLY what you had when you died. **Without an obituary, no assistance will be provided.** It's extremely rare for a gravestone to not spawn when you die. In most circumstances, your gravestone is not missing as much as it's in an unexpected place. Please check in the air above you and in the ground below you up to 32 blocks. If you died in lava, your gravestone may be at the bottom of the lava pit.

In rare circumstances, a gravestone can be lost in a brief window if you die during a specific garbage collection event in the JVM when the server was unable to do it's periodic save. We will more than likely provide assistance in these circumstances, but please be prepared to provide some proof of what was lost.

As much as we wish we could easily recover these things, there's no well supported mod to do this for our framework/version.

### If I teleport somewhere, will my dragon come with me?

The dragon will not teleport with you. While the dragon will pathfind back to you, the dragon has to be in loaded chunks in order to do it's pathfinding. The safest thing to do is craft a `Dragon Horn` and use it to store your dragon before any teleporting.
