To configure simple voice chat, I recommend the following steps:

1. Press `V` to bring up the configuration menu.
2. Make sure the eye in the bottom right corner does not have a red slash through it.
3. Click on settings:
   1. Voice Chat Volume: `110-120%`
   2. Microphone Amplification: `20-30%`
   3. Noise Suppression: `On`
   4. Activation Method: `Push To Talk`
   5. Push To Talk: _Your Own Preference_
   6. 3D Audio: `Reduced`
   7. Click on `Select Microphone` and find your mic. Then select back.
   8. Click on `Select Speaker` and find your headset or speakers. Then select back.
4. You should be good to go.
