Any Admin/Mod can assist you with buying a permit when they are online and ready to head over to the permit office.

You can only purchase one permit at a time, You may purchase another permit after your permanent shop has been built and is open for business.

There are "pop up shops" around the shopping district to use till your main shop has been built. Simply change the sign from "Available" to your name. Do not make substantial changes to the design of the pop up stand. Simply sell your goods in the provided barrels and the shop plugin also works on barrels.

## **Permit Prices**

- Diamond Tier - 3 Diamond Blocks
- Gold Tier - 2 Diamond Blocks
- Iron Tier - 1 Diamond Blocks
- Collectible - 5 Diamond Blocks

**Shopping Plots**

Once you get a permit you may pick a plot size in the shopping district that is not claimed. All plots will have a sign placed on them if it says available you may claim it, If there is a players name on it then it is already claimed.

Do not create more plots only Admins/Mods can add more plots if needed.

Only pick the plot size that you can fill with a build. _Do not pick a 32x32 plot if you build something that can fit inside a 16x16 plot._

There will be 3 different plot sizes and each size will have a set number that will be allowed.

**Plot Sizes**

- Yellow 16x16
- Green 26x26
- Red 32x32
