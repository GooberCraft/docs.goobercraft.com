## **Shop Rules**

- **Shop Plots:** Within your plot you will also have above ground and underground to build but, Do not build outside of your shop plot. No part of a shop (including underground areas and overhangs) may exceed the footprint of the plot it's on.
- **Maximum entities: 5.** This includes armor stands, item frames, etc. Please note that invisible entities like invisible item frames are part of that entity limit even though they do not have a visible hitbox.
- **No persistent mobs.** This includes both passive and hostile mobs. They will be removed.
- **No permanent beacons.** Beacons can be used temporarily during the construction of your shop. Beacons will only be at the district portal for easier navigation.
- **No automatic farms or brewers or super smelters.** No complex redstone contraptions.
- **Clearly sign your shop.** All shops must have an easily visible sign listing the shop owner(s) names.
- **You must be able to stock your shop.** Do not claim land for a shop unless you are able to provide the wares or services you intend to sell.
- **Keeping shops active.**
